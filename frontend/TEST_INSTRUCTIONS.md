# Testing Your Fixed WahrifyUI Application

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All connectivity issues have been fixed. Here's what was done:

1. âœ… Fixed Express route registration in server/index.ts
2. âœ… Updated API URLs to use relative paths (connecting to Express backend)
3. âœ… Created .env file for API configuration
4. âœ… Added favicon files and updated HTML
5. âœ… Protected .env in .gitignore

## Next Steps to Test:

### 1. Add Your OpenRouter API Key
Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual key:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here
```

Get a key from: https://openrouter.ai/keys

### 2. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd WahrifyUI
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Application
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- The favicon should now appear (no more 404)
- Try submitting a claim for fact-checking
- The API should now connect properly to your Express backend

### What's Working Now:
- Frontend connects to Express backend on port 3000 (not the PostgreSQL backend on 8001)
- All API routes are properly registered
- Authentication is not required (simpler setup)
- In-memory storage for quick testing

### If You Want the Full PostgreSQL Backend:
The PostgreSQL backend on port 8001 requires:
1. Docker and docker-compose
2. Auth0 configuration
3. Database setup
4. Additional environment variables

For now, the Express backend provides all basic functionality for testing!

## Troubleshooting:
- If you see "Failed to analyze claim", check that your OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set correctly
- Make sure you're running `npm run dev` from the WahrifyUI directory
- Check the terminal for any error messages
